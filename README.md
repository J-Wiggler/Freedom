## Concept
You are a catgirl in a society that hates catgirls. You live inside a cell in some lab where they do experiments on you and brainwash you into thinking that you live a normal life. However, one day after you are returned to your cell, due to a suspected resistance movement going on, and due to a technical malfunction, you end up escaping your cell. As you find the feeling of not being in your cell good, you roam around the lab until you are spotted and shot at. You do not understand why they shoot your ass, but you end up understanding that these people are not your amigos. You keep wandering until you end up in a room with a single person there. You threaten him, but unlike the others, he doesnt seem to want you dieded. With his help, you continue searching for a way out of the lab. When you find the way out, the resistance has also made it to the lab, and they help you out. However, after taking a few steps outside, you get gatted and die. The leader of the resistance finds your corpse and explains that this was the only freedom for you.
